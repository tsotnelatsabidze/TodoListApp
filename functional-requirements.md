# To-do List Application

## Functional Requirements

The goal of the To-Do List application is to provide end-users with the ability to manage their to-do lists and tasks.

The application users should be able to:
* View a list of available to-do lists, manage them, and change their properties.
* View the list of tasks in the to-do lists, manage tasks, and change their properties.
* View the list of assigned tasks, change the task status, and reassign the task to another user.
* Assign tags to tasks and view a list of all tags added to tasks.
* Add comments to tasks and view all comments added to tasks.
* Share to-do lists with other users, giving them the ability to view and manage the tasks the user has access to.

The idea behind the application you have to develop in this project is very similar to [Microsoft To Do](https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app) app. Check out this app to see what your app might look like, but keep in mind that the functionality of the two apps is different.


### Terms

* A *to-do list* is a group of tasks with their own properties. A to-do list has two properties: a title and a description of the list. A list title is a short name given to a to-do list. A description is text that explains what the to-do list is for or what items it contains.
* A *task* is a to-do list item that has its own properties: a title, a description of the task, the date when a task was created, the task due date, the task status, and the task assignee. When a task is created, it is assigned to the user who created the task, but the task can be reassigned to another user later.
* *Task status* describes the current state of the task; the status can be "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Completed".
* An *active task* is a task that has one of two statuses: "Not Started" or "In Progress".
* A *completed task* is a task that has the status "Completed".
* A *tag* is a text label a user can associate with a specific task; a task may have a few tags added to it.
* A *comment* is a text note a user can add to a specific task; a task may have a few comments added to it.
