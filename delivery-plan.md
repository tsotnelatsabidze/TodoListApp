# To-do List Application

## Development Tasks

Development tasks are tasks with a technical description of what needs to be done. The only development tasks T01-T04 have sub-tasks with details that can help you get started on the project.

* T01: Add and configure C# projects.
    * Create C# projects and add them to the solution file; configure project dependencies as expected.
    * Enable built-in .NET code analysis tools in C# projects; add the StyleCop NuGet package as a dependency to all C# projects.
* T02: Add and configure `TodoListDbContext`.
    * Create a database context for the *TodoListDb* database named `TodoListDbContext` in the *TodoListApp.Services.Database* project.
    * Configure `TodoListDbContext` as a dependency in *TodoListApp.WebApi* app's dependency injection container; the context must be initialized with a connection string added to the application config file.
* T03: Implement Epic 1 [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend) functionality in the *TodoList.WebApi* application.
    * Add a new entity class named `TodoListEntity` to the *TodoList.Services.Database* project; configure the entity as a DbSet<T> in the `TodoListDbContext` class.
    * Add a new service interface named `ITodoListService` and a data class named `TodoList` to the *TodoList.Services* project.
    * Add a new service class named `TodoListDatabaseService` to the *TodoList.Services.Database* project to manage to-do lists in the database; configure the service as a dependency in the *TodoList.WebApi* app.
    * Add a new controller class named `TodoListController` to the *TodoList.WebApi* project; resolve service dependencies using constructor injection.
    * US01: Add new methods to the `TodoListDatabaseService` to get the list of to-do lists from the database; make all necessary changes in other classes and methods.
    * US01: Implement the REST endpoint in the *TodoList.WebApi* project to get the list of to-do lists; the list must be in JSON format. Place the model classes for this endpoint in the *TodoListApp.WebApi.Models* project.

    * Add a new service class named `TodoListWebApiService` to the *TodoList.Services.WebApi* project to manage to-do lists in the web API app using REST API; configure the service as a dependency in the *TodoList.WebApp* app.
    * Add a new controller class named `TodoListController` to the *TodoList.WebApp* project; resolve service dependencies using constructor injection.
    * US01: Add a new method to the `TodoListWebApiService` to get the list of to-do lists using the REST API. Use the model classes in the *TodoListApp.WebApi.Models* project.
    * US01: Add a new view to the *TodoList.WebApp* project and a new method to the `TodoListController` class to show the list of to-do lists to the user using the browser UI.
    * US02: Add a new method to the `TodoListWebApiService` to add a new to-do list using the REST API. Use the model classes in the *TodoListApp.WebApi.Models* project.
    * US02: Add a new view to the *TodoList.WebApp* project and a new method to the `TodoListController` class to allow a user to add a new to-do list using the browser UI.
    * US03: Add a new method to the `TodoListWebApiService` to delete an existing to-do list using the REST API. Use the model classes in the *TodoListApp.WebApi.Models* project.
    * US03: Add a new view to the *TodoList.WebApp* project and a new method to the `TodoListController` class to allow a user to delete an existing to-do list using the browser UI.
    * US04: Add a new method to the `TodoListWebApiService` to update an existing to-do list's data using the REST API. Use the model classes in the *TodoListApp.WebApi.Models* project.
    * US04: Add a new view to the *TodoList.WebApp* project and a new method to the `TodoListController` class to allow a user to update an existing to-do list's data using the browser UI.
* T05: Implement Epic 2 backend functionality in the *TodoList.WebApi* application.
* T06: Implement Epic 2 frontend functionality in the *TodoList.WebApp* application.
* T07: Implement Epic 3 backend functionality in the *TodoList.WebApi* application.
* T08: Implement Epic 3 frontend functionality in the *TodoList.WebApp* application.
